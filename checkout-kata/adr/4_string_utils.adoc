*Title*: String utils

*Status*: _accepted_

*Context*: initially I was using apache-commons for a couple of StringUtils functions

*Decision*: I decided remove the external dependency and implement the method I needed. The implementation of StringUtils.isBlank have been copied from `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils`

*Consequences*: I do not have access to all the other extra functionality that comes with apache-commons but I don't have an extra dependency either
