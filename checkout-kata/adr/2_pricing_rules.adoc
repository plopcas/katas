*Title*: Pricing rules

*Status*: _accepted_

*Context*: we want to be able to pass in pricing rules before the checkout transaction so that we can reconfigure prices and discounts over time

*Decision*: all prices will be considered as integers in cents and stored in a CSV on disk. We could use a DB, API call or any other mechanism to load the prices. Everything will be encapsulated by a service so changing this will be easy moving forward if necessary

*Consequences*: pricing rules will have to be updated directly in the file before running the application
